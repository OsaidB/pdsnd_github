### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project analyzes bikeshare usage data from three major US cities — Chicago, New York City, and Washington — for the first half of 2017.

The script `bikeshare.py` provides an interactive terminal-based experience that allows users to:
- Select a city
- Filter the data by month and/or day
- View descriptive statistics, including:
  - Most common travel times
  - Most popular stations and trips
  - Total and average trip durations
  - User demographics (user types, gender, birth years)
  - Optionally view raw data in chunks

### Files used
- `bikeshare.py`: Python script for running the interactive data exploration
- `chicago.csv`: Bikeshare data for Chicago
- `new_york_city.csv`: Bikeshare data for New York City
- `washington.csv`: Bikeshare data for Washington, D.C.

### Credits
- Project framework and datasets provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
